# HIST_HU_URB

## Folder Descriptions

* *DATA_DOWNLOAD*: Contains final output .csv (in zipped folder) and shapefile (in file geodatabase).

* *gis_files*: Empty folder used to store GIS outputs from running the scripts.

* *output*: Contains data for further analysis of the HU counts. This folder will not be included in the final product. It is for our convenience.

* *scripts*: Contains the 17 scripts used to generate the FINAL data. Users should go through the scripts in the order they appear.

* *tables*: Contains prepared tables to be used in the data building process. These are included here rather than built in the code because either they were partially built using proprietary data (golf_table & urb_renewal_tracts), unavailable to be downloaded using the API (the two NHGIS zipped folders), or had to be built manually (county_tracts).
