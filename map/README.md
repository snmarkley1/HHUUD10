# Organization
This folder contains the elements of the ArcGIS Pro project where the Python code should be run. Users must have an [Esri User License](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/start-arcgis-pro-with-a-named-user-license.htm) to install ArcGIS Pro on their computers, run this code, and import some of the data used in the analysis. The coordinate system should be set to "USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic" (ESRI: 102003). Note that the `map.gdb` is not used for this project.
