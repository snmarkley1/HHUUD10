# Organization
This folder contains the elements of the ArcGIS Pro project (`map.aprx`) where the Python code should be run. It also contains an ArcMap project (`map.mxd`) that will be needed to run script `14_maximum_reabsorption_pt3`. 

To open these projects, users must have an [Esri User License](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/start-arcgis-pro-with-a-named-user-license.htm). This account is needed to install both ArcGIS Pro 2.7+ and ArcGIS Desktop 10.7+ on their computers, run the Python code, and import some of the data used in the analysis. The coordinate system for both the .aprx and .mxd files should be set to "USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic" (ESRI: 102003). Note that the `map.gdb` is not used for this project.
