# Organization and Further Instructions
This folder contains the R and Python scripts used to create HHUUD10. Here, we list each script and provide a brief description, as well as any additional instructions needed to ensure the code runs smoothly. These instructions are also listed within the scripts themselves. We recommend users run the Python scripts within ArcGIS Pro 2.7 or later, except for script `14_maximum_reabsorption_pt3.py`, which should be run in ArcGIS Desktop 10.7 or later.
