# Organization
This folder contains the elements of the ArcGIS Pro project (`map.aprx`) where the Python code for the validation tests should be run.

To open this project, users must have an [Esri User License](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/start-arcgis-pro-with-a-named-user-license.htm). This account is needed to install ArcGIS Pro 2.7+ and run the Python code. The coordinate system for the .aprx file should be set to "USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic" (ESRI: 102003). Note that the `map.gdb` is not used for this project.
